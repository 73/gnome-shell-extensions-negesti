                     Press twice to maximize the window

Modify the keybindings using gconf-editor. The Treenode is

2 screen setup support:
the extention works well with 2 screens in horizontal setup.
Moving windows from one screen to another only possible widh side_e and side_w
and only if windows was at side_e (or side_w) before.
eg.
* a window in corner_nw of the right screen is not move to the left screen.
* a window at side_e of the right screen is move to the left screen (side_w)


----------------- TODO --------------------------------
* 2 screens support vor vertical alignment
