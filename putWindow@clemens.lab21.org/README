If you enable this extension the metacity move window keybindings are
replaced.

Changes:

----- December 17, 2011
 * fix a bug that occures if the top panel is hidden.
 ->  checkout https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/42/auto-hide-top-panel/ it's awesome!

----- December 11, 2011

 * reduced the horizontal and vertical "gap" between windows
 * hitting move_to_center twice will now correctly maximize evolution

---------------

To check the predefined keyboard bindings (or modify them) open gconf-editor and
navigate to "apps.metacity.window_keybindings". (check the wiki for details)

- move_to_side_n.... move to north edge, height: 50% width 100%
- move_to_side_e.... move to easth edge, height: 100% width 50%
- move_to_side_s.... move to south edge, height: 50% width 100%
- move_to_side_w.... move to west  edge, height: 100% width 50%

- move_to_corners: widht 50% height 50%
-- ne, se, sw, nw

- move_to_center.... move to center of the screen, widht 50% height 50%
                     Press twice to maximize the window

Modify the keybindings using gconf-editor. The Treenode is
apps.metacity.window_keybindings.

* 2 screen setup support:
  the extention works well with 2 screens in horizontal setup.
  Moving windows from one screen to another only possible widh side_e and side_w
  and only if windows was at side_e (or side_w) before. eg.
* a window in corner_nw of the right screen is not move to the left screen.
* a window at side_e of the right screen is move to the left screen (side_w)


----------------- TODO --------------------------------
* 2 screens support vor vertical alignment
* a lot of things i currently dont remember :)
