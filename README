To check the predefined keyboard bindings (or modify them) open gconf-editor and

If you enable this extension the functionality of metacity move window
keybindings are replaced:

- move_to_side_e.... move to easth edge, height: 100% width 50%
- move_to_side_s.... move to south edge, height: 50% width 100%
- move_to_side_w.... move to west  edge, height: 100% width 50%

- move_to_corners: widht 50% height 50%
-- ne, se, sw, nw

- move_to_center.... move to center of the screen, widht 50% height 50%
                     Press twice to maximize the window

2 screen setup support:
the extention works well with 2 screens in horizontal setup.
Moving windows from one screen to another only possible with side_e and side_w
and only if windows was at side_e (or side_w) before. eg.
* a window in corner_nw of the right screen is not move to the left screen.
* a window at side_e of the right screen is move to the left screen (side_w)
